👋 Hi, I’m Luiz Martins
======================

Based in **Maringá, Paraná, Brazil**, and building things that sit close to the metal or make developers happier. I’m curious about operating systems, systems programming, and practical ways to ship reliable software.

**Now:** learning Rust and OS internals, and looking to contribute more to open-source projects that improve my engineering chops.

---

🧭 What I like working on
-------------------------

- Systems programming experiments (Rust, OS building blocks, language runtimes)
- Tools and docs that make engineers faster and more confident
- Sharing notes so others can learn alongside me
